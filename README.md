# Building-Level DC Aware Intelligent Energy Management System Realization

# This repository is under development. 

## Abstract: 
This paper presents a practical implementation of 
a  comprehensive  Direct  Current  (DC)-aware 
hardware/software  solution  designed  to  equip  photovoltaic-
integrated  buildings  with  an  intelligent  energy  management 
system. The proposed platform incorporates both hardware and 
software  components,  including  a  real-time  control  unit,  AI-
powered  forecasting  services  for  solar  power  generation  and 
demand, and IoT-based wireless DC power outlets. The system 
enables  buildings  to  monitor,  manage,  and  optimize  internal 
energy flows, participate in energy markets, and contribute to 
intelligent, renewable energy-centered DC-dominant networks. 
Experimental tests and analysis demonstrate the performance 
and potential of the proposed platform.
